#
#   This is the core configuration for a configuration service.  I have two examples here:
#
#       -  A configuration service which completelty loads the configuration for the services
#          from the local file server of the config service.  This should only be used for
#          demonstration purposes or for a small application with a limited number of services.
#
#       -  A configuraton service that uses a git-based repository to read the files from. Slowly added
